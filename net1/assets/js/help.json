Assuming you have installed via composer\nyou would create an API provider using the following code.\n\nimport com.google.gson.Gson;\nimport netistrar.clientapi.APIProvider;\n\nString endpoint = \"APIENDPOINTURL\";\nString apiKey = \"YOURAPIKEY\";\nString apiSecret = \"YOURAPISECRET\";\n\nAPIProvider provider = new APIProvider(endpoint, apiKey, apiSecret);\n\nThe APIENDPOINTURL referenced above should be set to one of the following values:\n\nOTE: https://restapi.netistrar-ote.uk\n\nProduction: https://restapi.netistrar.com \n\nYour API Key and Secret can be looked up in My Account - API Settings in the Netistrar control panel.\n\nYou can then access the various APIs using a convention which matches the REST path for each API as described in the Reseller API Reference guide \n\ne.g. the ping method on the Utility API would be accessed using the following method on the provider object.\n\nprovider.utility().ping();\n\nNote on Descriptor Objects\n\nMany of the API methods require complex structures which are supplied using descriptor objects.  As many of these contain \na number of optional properties these typically provide a blank and a full constructor for all properties as well as setter chaining for \nmore terse object construction.\n\ne.g. the hintedAvailability method on the Domains API accepts a DomainNameAvailabilityDescriptor object as it's main object.  This \nobject only requires the searchString member to be supplied.  Suppose you also wanted to set the suggestions boolean to true as well you \ncould do either of the following.\n\nDomainNameAvailabilityDescriptor descriptor = new DomainNameAvailabilityDescriptor(\"test\", null, null, true, null);\n\nDomainAvailabilityResults results = provider.domains().hintedAvailability($descriptor);\n\nor\n\nDomainNameAvailabilityDescriptor descriptor = new DomainNameAvailabilityDescriptor().setSearchString(\"test\").setSuggestions(true);\n\nDomainAvailabilityResults results = provider.domains().hintedAvailability($descriptor);\n\n Examples\n\nYou can download a comprehensive test/example script \nwhich demonstrates all of the key features of the API here.  \n\nPlease Note:  As the test script\nperforms domain registrations and renewals it must only be run against the OTE environment.\n\nPlease refer to the Reseller API Reference guide for documentation on the various APIs available.

For example, you may set up a 'www' record to send traffic to your website server or hosting provider, and you may set up mail exchange records (MX records) to send traffic to your email provider.\n\nNetistrar provides a FREE DNS service without a commercial Service Level Agreement.  It is in our interest to maintain a reliable DNS service, and in the background we use third-party providers such as Cloudflare to maintain business continuity.  For mission-critical services we recommend that you use your own commercial DNS provider (note we have our own Commercial DNS offerings in the pipeline).  Note, we do not enable other Cloudflare services, such as Application firewalls, caching, etc.  To enable those services you can register your own Cloudflare account, and set your own Nameservers to those provided by Cloudflare. \n\nNote: for any services that you purchase through Netistrar, such as G Suite and email services, we offer to make this job easier for you by automatically setting up DNS records to resolve these services for you. \n\nTransfers\n\nIf you are either transferring a Domain Name to Netistrar from another provider, or transferring your DNS services to Netistrar, we will attempt to detect any published DNS records to use as a starting point.  Please review these records before saving them for use in production.\n\n Setting DNS Records\n\nHaving set your Nameservers to 'use Netistrar FREE DNS' you can then add your own DNS records, as below. There are plenty of tutorials online about DNS records and how they work. \n\nRecord types\n\nHere are the different types of DNS records supported:\n\ndl\ndtAddress Mapping - A records/dt\nddThe record specifies an IPV4 address for a host./dd\ndtAddress Mapping - AAAA records/dt\nddThe record specifies an IPV6 address for a host./dd\n\ndtCanonical Name - CNAME records/dt\n\nddThe record specifies a domain name that has to be queried to resolve a domain name.  A domain name alias./dd\n\ndtMail Exchange - MX records/dt\n\nddThe record specifies a mail server for a host./dd\n\ndtAddress Mapping - A records/dt\n\nddThe record specifies an IPV4 address for a host./dd\n\ndtNameserver - NS records/dt\n\nddThe record specifies a Nameserver for the host./dd\n\ndtService of Authority - SOA records/dt\n\nddThe record specifies information about a DNS zone, primary nameserver, administrator, and refresh rate.  See this WIKI for a more detailed explanation. /dd \n\ndtReverse-lookup Pointer - PTR records/dt\n\nddThe record provides reverse lookup information - as opposed to an A record which is used to lookup an IP address for a given domain name, a PTR record is used to lookup a domain name from a given IP address./dd\n\ndtText - TXT records/dt\n \nddThe record specifies an arbitary string value.  Often you may be asked by an email provider, such as Google to create a TXT record for security purposes, so that they may use Sender Policy Framework (SPF) technology to check the authenticity of emails sent using your domain name./dd\n\n/dl\n\n",

Your email provider will provide you with the required MX records information. Steps for two of the most popular email services, Gmail by Google and Microsoft Office 365 are detailed below.\n\nEditing your own MX records using the Netistrar DNS system\n\nWe provide full guidance for managing DNS records in the help documentation for managing DNS records, here we focus on managing MX records (Mail Exchange Server records) for email services.\n\n  From Dashboard  Address Book  Contact Templates\n\nTo add or edit MX records for a domain registered on (or transferred to) Netistrar in conjunction with Cloudflare DNS, go to your Dashboard, then select the 'Manage Domains' option, and find the domain you wish to add/edit records for by searching in the bar above the list of domains. Click on the domain you wish to change. Then go to the 'DNS' option on the left hand menu. If you wish to edit an existing record, do this by hitting the pencil icon next to that record. To a new MX (or TXT) record, click 'Add DNS record' at the top.\n\n Gmail by Google\n\nAs an official Google Cloud Partner, Netistrar offers the full range of G Suite packages (Basic, Business and Enterprise) including Gmail to our customers at discount to published prices.\n\nWe also configure all DNS MX records and settings to make your email work with your own domain name out of the box.\np class=\"pt1 pb3 flex-grid\"\na class=\"button chevron-right mt3\" href=\"/email/gsuite\"Review our G Suite packages/a\n/p\nConfiguring your own Gmail settings\nSetup of G Suite (formerly Google Apps) with your domain is easy with Netistrar. No manual entry of MX records is required. Simply go to your Dashboard, hit Manage Domains, choose the domain you wish to setup with G Suite, and hit Email on the left hand menu.\n\nGo to your G Suite Admin console, and find your G Suite verification code, with the format google-site-verification=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx.... \n\nCopy this value onto your clipboard and paste it into the 'Verification code' box under the 'Google Apps for email' heading on the Netistrar email page, then simply hit 'Setup Google Apps for email'. Note: confirming this will wipe any previous MX records associated with your domain.\n\nNetistrar will automatically setup the required MX records and verification for your domain. You can check this by scrolling to the bottom of the page and seeing the list of google MX records.\n\nIf G Suite is already setup with a different Google account and you wish to change it, merely paste your new Google verification code into the 'Verification code' box and click 'Reset Google Apps for email settings'. Note: confirming this will wipe any previous MX records associated with your domain.\n\nIf you wish to set up G Suite manually (not recommended), see https://support.google.com/a/answer/140034 for info on G Suite MX record setup.\n\n Microsoft Office 365\nTo setup Office 365 with a domain you operate on Netistrar, we recommend following the general steps at Microsoft's official guide: https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/Create-DNS-records-for-Office-365-at-any-DNS-hosting-provider-7b7b075d-79f9-4e37-8a9e-fb60c1d95166. \n\nMicrosoft requires you to use a verification key with your MX records.
