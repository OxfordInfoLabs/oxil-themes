G Suite Business is the enhanced office suite of Google services. In addition to everything available in G Suite Basic, it includes features listed below.

__Unlimited storage__

With G Suite Business, each user in your organization can store unlimited Gmail messages, Google Photos, and files in Drive. Or if there are 4 or fewer users in your organization, each user gets 1 TB of storage.

__Company-wide search__

Users can also use Google Cloud Search to: 
 
- Search for company content across Gmail,  Docs, Calendar, and their other G Suite services
- Receive useful information and suggestions from assist cards
 

__Team Drives__

With Team Drives, files belong to a team instead of an individual. If members leave, files stay where they are so the team can continue to share information and get work done. 

__Administrator controls__

Archiving with Vault
Use Vault to retain, archive, search, and export your organization's data for eDiscovery and compliance needs. 

__Advanced reports__

Advanced Drive audit reporting, custom alerts, and APIs. 
Mobile audits and alerts, such as when a device is compromised. 

__Drive activity alerts__

Get custom alerts on Drive activity, such as when documents are shared outside your domain. 

__Security keys__

Deploy and monitor security keys for your organization, and purchase them at a discounted rate. 

__Extra policy controls__
