Buying a Domain Name is simple - from any Domain Name search box simply enter a name you would like to have as a Domain Name and review the results.  The name can be any combinations of letters and numbers, your brand, your own name, a business name - anything you like.  Once you have entered the name, we will then show you prices, availability, and perhaps suggest alternative that are available to purchase today.
  
If you find a Domain Name you like, add it to the cart, buy it, and wait for our system to confirm registration.

## Where can I find a search box?

You'll find a Domain Name search boxes on the Home Page, throughout the website, and at the top of your Dashboard.  Here's one - 

{{% domain-search class="white-text ge pt2 pb3 my2 " %}}

<h3>Enter a word, name or keyphrase into the box below</h3>

{{% /domain-search %}}  



## What next?

Once you have purchased a Domain Name, congratulations, you now control an internet domain name and you have a number of options.

### 1. Keep it and decide what to do later.
This is a reasonable option.  It's yours to do what you want with during the registration period.  You have a right to renew the registration at the end of the registration period.  You can 'add years' to the registration period at any time (up to the maxium allowed for that particular Domain Name - usually 10 years).  And most importantly, nobody else can register it!

### 2. Use your Domain Name for professional email.

   > Get a professional email address  
   __me@mydomain.com__
   
   
    
[Visit here to choose an email plan](/email/gsuite/), and we'll do all the configuration for you.

### 3. Configure it for your website.

Following website hosting provider's instructions to configure the website to work with any of the following:

- An external domain
- A custom domain
- External DNS

__Ignore__ any instructions to transfer the Domain Name to the hosting provider as a pre-requisite - this is is not a requirement of any quality hosting provider, and there are plently of good hosting providers that will support a standard configuration to work with externally managed domain names.

Once you have purchased a Domain Name you can access its Nameserver settings and DNS records from your Dashboard.
