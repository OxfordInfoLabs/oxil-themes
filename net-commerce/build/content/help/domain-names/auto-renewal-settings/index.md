Auto-renewal is the automatic renewal of a domain name's registration period using a payment card or balance on your account.

Setting up auto-renwewal is one of our [10 Tips to Improve Website Security](/blog/10-tips-to-improve-website-security/).  Failed domain name renewal is one of top reasons why a website may suffer an outage or loss of business continuity.  We advise all customers to set up auto-renewal on each domain name they manage.

_Note: auto-renewal can only be applied to a domain name if there is an active payment card or enough balance in your account._
