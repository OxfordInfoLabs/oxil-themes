    From Dashboard > Domains > YOURDOMAIN.COM > Adding years
    
Domain Names are purchased in multiples of years.  Here you can review the expiry date of your domain, ie. the date it will stop routing, and also add years to the domain, ie. extend its registration period.  

_Note: additional years will run from the expiry date or the date of payment, whichever is the later_.
