    From Dashboard > Domains
    
We operate a system of domain name forwarding (the ability to route all traffic to another URL) for all domain names in your account.

Locate the domain name for which you wish to enable Forwarding.  Click 'Forwarding' from the domain summary screen.

Enter a forward URL where indicated.

_Note all traffic will be routed to your given URL._
