The Domain Names area of your dashboard is where your configure your internet assets, email and websites, to work with domain names.  Domain Names and their settings (particularly DNS settings) are where you manage routing - the routing of internet traffic from a domain name to a website, and also email resolution, the routing of email traffic from a sender to an email server using a Domain Name as an address. 

In this area you can also manage Domain Name ownership information, public (WHOIS) information, domain security, and billing settings.

It is the heart of your internet asset management system.
