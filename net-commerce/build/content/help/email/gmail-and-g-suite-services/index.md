This is the Help documentation for all editions G Suite provided by {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}}.  Note, __Google provides all support for their products and services__ 24 hrs 7 days per week (details below) and {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} provides support for billing, upgrades and integration with other {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} products.


## Getting started
{{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} offers G Suite plans to customers at discounted rates providing customers with a single place to manage domain names and other internet assets, websites, certificates, and easy set up.

To purchase a G Suite plan for 1 or more users, simply [compare the editions](/email/gsuite/) and then click on 'More details' to review specific details for each  plan.

Having settled on a plan you then need to select the 'Number of seats' and the 'Payment Plan' for your product.

## Number of Seats (Licenses)

Number of seats equates to number of users who will have an account in your organisation's G Suite account.  The minimum number of users is 1.  The first user added to the system will be a Super User with all Administration privileges in G Suite.  _Note, you can change this later if you have more than 1 user. You can assign Super User Privileges to any other user with an account in the same system_.

## Payment Plans

You have the choice of two payment plans, Monthly and Annual.  Monthly gives you more flexibility, you can add/remove licenses/users at any time and cancel services without penalty.  

With the Annual Plan you gain further discounts by committing to purchase the service for a full year in advance.  You can add extra licenses at any time for an additional cost which is calculated on a pro-rata basis.  You can reduce licenses only when renewing your plan at the end of the year.


## Setting up your account

Once you have added a G Suite Edition to the cart, you can continue to checkout to setup your G Suite account.  Note, you can also set up your account at any time after checkout from the 'G Suite' section of your dashboard.

### Step 1 - choose a domain name.  

This can be either a domain name that you are purchasing (it needs to be in your cart!), a domain name in your account (if you have a domain name that you have purchased in the past it will be displayed here), or setup later. 

_Note: this will be the domain name that will become active for all your G Suite functions, e.g. myexampledomain.com will active for all your Gmail addresses (support@myexampledomain.com, joebloggs@myexampledomain.com, etc.)._

### 2. Choose account contact. 


Choose a contact from your address book (any addresses that we have on file under your account).  This is the contact information that will be supplied to Google.  Google may use this information to contact you directly. 

_Note, Google requires an alternative email address at this stage to use as a secondary email address for setting up verification and recovery. If you wish to use a different contact address please add a new contact into your address book._
    
### 3. Set up your first Super User

Enter a name and email address for your first G Suite Super User.  Your first user setup by {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} will have Super User Privileges and absolute control over the G Suite account for your Domain.  Choose an email address for this user that you want to stick with (it can be changed later but it can be tricky).  With this user you will be able to perform all administrator functions on your account, including creating more Administrators, Super Users, and users.

### A Note about DNS Records

If we are managing your DNS records then your G Suite account will be automatically setup after payment.  Once we have configured your G Suite account we will confirm the administration details, and Google will write to you directly with further instructions.
                                                                                                           

If we are not managing your DNS records please follow [Google's instructions](https://support.google.com/a/answer/140034?hl=en) to configure your DNS records for your new G Suite account.  Here are [further instructions to configure your DNS records](/help/domain-names/dns/) from your Dashboard.



### Getting started in G Suite

This stage is optional, there are a myriad of features and settings in the G Suite package for you to play with and get to learn over time.  Some default functionality is provided at the outset with basic Gmail and Drive services provided out of the box.

First, decide who is going to be the Administrator of the account, and that person should become familiar all the options available and partcularly how to administer other users.  The packages offer fine grained control of Users, Group and Permissions and the system can be configured with increasingly sophisticated levels of functionality as required. 

For more Help and Information about administering and setting up your G Suite account visit the [G Suite Learning Center](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/#!/).

## Administering your account
To administer your account, follow the instructions to '[Sign in to your Admin console](https://support.google.com/a/answer/182076?hl=en)' at Google.

Support requests are raised through your Super Administration.  {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} sets up your first Super Administration automatically as the first licensed user of your account.


## Support for G Suite and Gmail

Support for G Suite products are provided by Google.  Support is available for your G Suite Administrator at [G Suite Admin Help](https://support.google.com/a/#topic=7570177).  _Note: {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} cannot assist with G Suite product related queries._

You can contact G Suite Support using a number of options provided by Google at '[Contact G Suite Support](https://support.google.com/a/answer/1047213?hl=en&ref_topic=7067151)'.

Locate the correct G Suite account using the primary domain name.  Click 'Manage G Suite' for that account, then click 'Upgrade' from the Subscription section of the G Suite account summary screen.      

## Upgrading your plan

    From Dashboard > G Suite
    
Locate the correct G Suite account using the primary domain name.  Click 'Manage G Suite' for that account, then click 'Settings' from the Billing section of the G Suite account summary screen. 

## Termination

For Monthly plans, you can cancel your subscription at any time and your plan will be scheduled to be deleted by Google at the end of the currently active monthly period.

For Annual plans, if you cancel your subscription before the end of the year you still pay for the full year, which is usually collected in advance.
