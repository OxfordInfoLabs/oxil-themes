{{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} provides basic email forwarding for any Domain Name in your account.

Locate the domain name for which you wish to enable Email Forwarding.  Click 'Email', then enter an email forwarding address in the Email forwarding section of the domain summary screen. 

_Note: although we make every effort to provide you with a convenient and reliable email forwarding service, this service is offered as is, with no service level.  We do not recommend this for high priority email forwarding services._


For business email including email forwarding we recommend G Suite provided Google.  We provide the full range of G Suite subscriptions at discounted rates, and we automate configuring G Suite to work with any Domain Name in your account.
