## Public WHOIS services
{{< site-param "shortTitle" >}}, as an accredited Netistrar Reseller operates under domain name rules [ICANN RAA 2013](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/approved-with-specs-2013-09-17-en). Under those rules we are able to offer Privacy Proxy services to domain name registrants/owners (both businesses and individuals) who may wish to hide their registration details (address, email, telephone, etc.) from public view.

Unless otherwise protected by Privacy Proxy Services, {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} is required to publish all domain name ownership records on public [WHOIS servers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois). Sometimes this may be desirable, for example businesses want to publish contact information as a form of advertising, others may wish to keep their contact information concealed from public gaze.

Whilst many service providers often charge a fee to provide Privacy Proxy Services, {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} offers basic Privacy Proxy Services FREE of charge. Follow [this link](/help/privacy-and-whois-services/your-privacy-settings/) to find out how to enable Privacy Proxy Services for domain name managed under a {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} account.

{{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} intends to offer premium Privacy Proxy Services for business customers and their clients in the future. {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} anticipates making a small charge for those enhanced premium services but a base level of Privacy Proxy Service will continue to be offered for FREE.
