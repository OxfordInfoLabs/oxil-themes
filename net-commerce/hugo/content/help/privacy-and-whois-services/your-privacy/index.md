A full explanation of Privacy Proxy services and requirements for domain name owners to display accurate information on public WHOIS servers is provided under our [Privacy Proxy Terms](/terms/privacy-proxy-terms). 

To protect your domain name ownership information from public display on WHOIS records simply login to your Dashboard and click on any domain (under the 'Domains' menu item).

    From Dashboard > Domains > example.com > Privacy Settings

Select an option to either Hide all ownership details, Publish limited details, or Publish all details.  Consult the screen information for the most up to date details.

Note: Active privacy proxy records are replaced by registrar or reseller information by default. Note,  laws require registrars to reveal domain name ownership information to anyone making a reasonable request, such as law enforcement and brand protection organisations.

## Transfers and unlocking a domain name
To transfer domain names between registrars you must ensure that the WHOIS records contain accurate information.  To unlock a domain name for transfer, deactivate Privacy Proxy settings to reveal the underlying Registrant information.  It is this information that a new Registrar will use to verify domain name ownership during the domain name transfer process.  Please note: private information is no longer protected by Privacy Proxy during the transfer process.
