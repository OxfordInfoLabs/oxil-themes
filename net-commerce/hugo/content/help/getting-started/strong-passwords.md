Following [HM Government UK advice](https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/passwords) we recommend that you use strong passwords to deter cyber attacks and criminals gaining to your accounts.

The effect of a cyber attack on a domain name management account, such as your account with {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}}, could seriously impact your business or operations.  Please follow the guidance about how to generate a strong password, the qualities of a strong password, and password security in general.

#### 2-Factor authentication
For additional security, we also recommend that you enable 2-Factor authentication on your ENWAU account.  Please follow [these instructions to set up 2-Factor authentication on your account](/help/getting-started/2-factor-authentication/ ).
