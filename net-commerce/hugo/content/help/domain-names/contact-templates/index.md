Contact templates are archetypes for [Domain Name contact information](/help/domain-names/contact-details/) that can be applied to domain name records.  Typically, a contact template is used to group domain name ownership information, and to keep records consistent.  It also saving time taken up with data-entry, once you have created a perfect set of contact details (which may published - see [WHOIS Services](/help/privacy-and-whois-services/)) you may use them over and over again.

### When to use contact templates

Contact templates are particularly useful for the following.

- Bulk amendments to Domain Name contact records
- Domain name purchasing
- Editing domain name contact records, ie. to easily provide a set of contact records (including technical, billing, admin contact information).
