In this section you can access your domain name security settings to unlock a domain name and gain access to its transfer auth-code.

Note, carefully managing the auth-code is one of our [10 Tips to Improve Website Security](/blog/10-tips-to-improve-website-security/).  Once an unlock authorisation code has been generated for a domain name, the owner of that auth-code essentially owns your domain name.

We strongly advise that you strictly control access to domain name auth-codes, and that you keep domain names 'locked' at all times.

Once a domain name has been transferred out of the {{< site-param "shortTitle" >}} system there is very little we can to do help you manage a domain name or its connected services.

_Note, in certain circumstances your domain will be locked automatically in accordance with ICANN rules. For examples, domains must be locked for a period of 60 days following transfer, or changes to ownership information_.
