## Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP)

{{< site-param "netistrarResellerIntro" >}}

Netistrar Registry Data Access Protocol (RDAP) Service allows users to look up registration data for generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs), in accordance with applicable ICANN Consensus Policies.

By using the Netistrar RDAP Service, you confirm and warrant that you have a lawful basis (as described in Article 6 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation, the GDPR) for requesting the data and will ensure that any data acquired as a result of this request (the 'requested data') will be processed in accordance with applicable laws including without limitation GDPR.

By using the Netistrar RDAP Service you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Netistrar, its agents, partners, affiliates and directors from and against any and all claims, losses, liabilities, damages, settlements, expenses and costs (including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and court costs) which arise out of or relate to your non-compliance with or any breach of your warranty (above) in relation to gTLD registration data.

By using the Netistrar RDAP Service, you agree not to conduct any automated or excessive queries, and that your utilisation of the Netistrar RDAP Service shall not exceed any limits applied by Netistrar's automated systems. If your utilisation of Netistrar RDAP Service exceeds such limits, or in our sole opinion poses a threat to the stability of Netistrar's technical systems or the internet, we may throttle or limit your access to the Netistrar RDAP Service, or in our sole discretion terminate your access to the Netistrar RDAP Service.

Netistrar reserves the right to suspend some or all of the Netistrar RDAP Service in order to carry out scheduled or emergency maintenance or repairs, or to take appropriate measures to contain cyberattacks including but not limited distributed denial of service attacks (DDoS).
